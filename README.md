# 🌸Afreen Aurshi-Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, designed and built to showcase my work, skills, and creative direction as a Graphic Designer with a design-first mindset.

The project is inspired by my original Figma design and focuses on clean visuals, subtle interactions, and a minimal yet expressive layout.



## ✨Overview
-  Design-centric portfolio website

- Clean and minimal hero section

- Smooth scrolling and subtle animations

- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

- Organized and scalable project structure

This portfolio represents my creative journey and experimentation with modern front-end tools while keeping the original design aesthetics intact.
