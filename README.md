# Portfolio
This repository contains my personal portfolio website, designed and built to showcase my work, skills, and creative direction as a Graphic Designer with a design-first mindset.

The project is inspired by my original Figma design and focuses on clean visuals, subtle interactions, and a minimal yet expressive layout.

✨ Overview

Design-centric portfolio website

Clean and minimal hero section

Smooth scrolling and subtle animations

Responsive layout for different screen sizes

Organized and scalable project structure

This portfolio represents my creative journey and experimentation with modern front-end tools while keeping the original design aesthetics intact.
